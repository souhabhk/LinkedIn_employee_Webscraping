# LinkedIn Employee Webscraping

Welcome to the "LinkedIn Employee Webscraping Project." This project is dedicated to the pursuit of gathering valuable insights into the key personnel of companies on our designated list. A sophisticated web scraping script has been meticulously designed and executed for this purpose.

## Project Overview

In the pursuit of extracting vital information about major employees in companies, our dynamic and sophisticated script adeptly traverses LinkedIn. It begins by identifying each company's name from their respective LinkedIn URLs. The script then systematically searches and collects data on individuals who hold prominent positions within the organizations included in our list.

The script focuses on collecting data about individuals with specific job titles such as "CEO," "Founder," "Owner," "Chef," "CTO," "Chief," "Executive," "Partner," "Director," "Vice President," "Directeur," "Fondateur," "DGA," "PDG," "RH," "Responsible." This approach ensures that we gather data on key personnel across different industries and sectors.

## Methodology

Employing a systematic and thorough approach, our script iterates through LinkedIn search results, capturing pertinent details such as names, job titles, locations, and profile links of individuals who fit the predefined criteria. This method ensures the comprehensive compilation of valuable data for our analysis.

## Benefits

The script's ability to adapt to different company profiles and the precision with which it identifies major employees highlight its effectiveness in assisting our research efforts. This innovative approach empowers us with a robust dataset for further analysis and strategic decision-making, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the corporate landscape.
